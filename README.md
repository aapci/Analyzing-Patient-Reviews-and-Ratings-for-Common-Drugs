Analyzing Patient Reviews and Ratings for Common Drugs using Power BI

This project uses Power BI to analyze patient reviews and ratings for common drugs. The goal of the project is to provide insights into how patients perceive and rate different drugs, as well as identify common themes and issues that arise in their reviews.

Getting Started

To run the project, you will need to have Power BI Desktop installed on your machine. You can download it from the Microsoft website.

After you have downloaded and installed Power BI Desktop, you can open the Analyzing Patient Reviews and Ratings for Common Drugs.pbix file to view the dashboard.

Data Sources

The data for this project was extracted from Drugs.com, an online resource that provides information on prescription drugs, over-the-counter medicines, and natural products. The data includes reviews and ratings for over 100 common drugs.

Dashboard Overview

The dashboard consists of several visualizations that allow users to explore the patient reviews and ratings data. Here is a brief overview of each visualization:

Word Cloud: A visual representation of the most commonly mentioned words in patient reviews.
Ratings Distribution: A bar chart that shows the distribution of ratings for each drug.
Popularity by Drug Class: A treemap that shows the popularity of different drug classes based on the number of reviews.
Review Categories: A stacked column chart that displays the distribution of reviews across different categories.

Users can interact with the dashboard by selecting specific drugs, review categories, and time periods using the filter panel.
